# Workshop Promotion Policy

- One of the criteria to be eligible to pass the APS145 course is to **complete a set minimum number of workshops**. Please consult your course **ADDENDA** for details. If you complete more than the minimum, your best top minimum number will be used in the calculation of your overall workshops grade
- You must submit a minimum of one presentation
- Workshop group solutions and presentations will be evaluated using the **published workshop rubrics** - see the posted rubrics on your course management system (Blackboard)

## Workshops

- Every student **MUST** be present in-class and actively contribute towards the workshop solution.
- Members who do not actively contribute towards the workshop solution will receive a **ZERO grade for the workshop**
- Members who receive a zero grade for the workshop, will **NOT count towards a completed workshop**

### Sub-Group Solution

- It is **minimally expected the group will work together to form a solution and further test, refine, and enhance all logic to create an overall uniform cohesive solution.**
- The group solution is due by the **end of the class for the assigned workshop week** (unless otherwise instructed by your professor).
- **The full name of all CONTRIBUTING members** MUST be stated at the top of all electronic/physical pages.
  - List **only the members who actually contributed** towards your group solution.

    :::warning WARNING
    Members who simply "attend" but do nothing should not receive credit!

    Active contribution is achieved when all members **interact** during the:
    - creation of the solution
    - applying refinements
    - testing the logic
    :::

- If not submitted on-time, a **ZERO grade** will be applied for the workshop
- If the submitted solution is merely thrown together with no effort to provide a seamless overall solution, a **ZERO grade** will be applied for the workshop.
- **Under no circumstances is the group solution to be done by an individual.**
  - The group solution is expected to be done by **ALL members working together** refining and testing the logic to ensure the solution properly addresses the workshop problem.

:::important NOTE
Do you have missing members or members who did not contribute?

It is still the **responsibility of the GROUP** to provide a **FULL SOLUTION** which may require extra effort to compensate for the lack of help from other members. In these situations, a minimum **10% bonus** will be applied (per missing/non-contributing member).
:::

## Video Presentation

- Presentations are due **6-days AFTER the group solution**. That is, **by the end of day (23:59 EST) 1-day BEFORE the following workshop class**
- Each student MUST do a video presentation **at least once** by the end of the term.
- Review the posted **grading rubric** (on Blackboard) carefully to see how you are graded and the grade distribution.
- Your presentation should **minimally** consist of the following:

  - Must properly identify the audience and use non-technical language
  - Always provide a **description of the problem** and summarize what your solution does to address it.
  - The **majority of the grade** is based on your demonstration of the envisioned solution which **must contain** mock screenshots or wire-framing of how you foresee the application interface would look like and how it would be used.
  - Must include a demonstration of **all major workflows** to convincingly sell your solution.
  - NEVER explain HOW things work - but **DO** demonstrate **WHAT** the solution does.
  - NEVER include pseudo code, flowcharts, or source code. Think of the presentation as a commercial advertisement, but directed at a specific/targeted audience.

:::warning WARNING
Failure to provide the above mandatory components will result in no grade (submission will **NOT be graded**)
