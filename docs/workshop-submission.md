## Email: SUBJECT Line

- The email subject line must contain:

  - The full course code identifier (Ex: **APS145**)
  - Section code identifier (Ex: **NAA**)
  - Workshop identifier and number (Ex: **W1**)
  - Group identifier and number (Ex: **G2**)
  - Member identifier and number (Ex: **M1**)
    - Note: The member Identifier is only required for the video presentation submission.

- All characters must be **UPPERCASE** and must **NOT contain SPACES**
- **Example-1 (Sub-Group Submission)**: If you are in section NBB and submitting your video presentation for workshop #4, and in group #3, then you would use the following email subject line:

  ```
    APS145-NBB-W4-G3
  ```

- **Example-2 (Video Presentation)**: If you are in section NBB and submitting your video presentation for workshop #4, in group #3, and are member #5, then you would use the following email subject line:

  ```
    APS145-NBB-W4-G3-M5
  ```

### Pseudo Code

- The file you submit must be a raw/pure TEXT file that can be opened on any operating system using a basic text editor
- It must have the extension ".txt"
- The **file name** must contain your group number
  **Example**:

  ```
  group3.txt
  ```

- **ATTACH** the file to the email (**NO LINKS**) and send!

### Flowchart

- The file you submit must be an image and should not have an alpha colour channel which can obscure the visibility of the lines. Therefore, the image **must be a JPG** file type with the extension .jpg
- The **file name** must contain your group number
  **Example**:

  ```
  group3.jpg
  ```

- **ATTACH** the file to the email (**NO LINKS**) and send!

### Presentation Submission

Video files can be quite large and will most likely be rejected by Seneca's email services. Therefore, you will have to SHARE your video file using your Seneca account Microsoft OneDrive.

- Create your video, and save it in a .MP4 video file format (**ONLY the .MP4 video file format will be accepted**)
- The video file name should consist of your full name only.

  **Example**: If your name is Claira Henderson...

  ```
  Claria Henderson.mp4
  ```
